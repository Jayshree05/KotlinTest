Main problem is that in project we have multiple activities and if we have multiple activity then we have viewmodel &
each viewmodel have its factory so its not a valid code structure.

 & for resolve this issue we have to finalize one viewmodel in whole project

 -----
 so we use multi bindinding ---> we create ViewModelModule

 - In this we have 2 object with same refrence(ViewModel) then in this manner dagger has confuse which object I create
 so resolve this problem we have to add either qualifier or map, stringRef

 ApplicationComponent
 ViewModelmodule


 @StringKey("mainViewModel")
